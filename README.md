[Department of Computer Science](http://lehman.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science/index.php), Lehman College  
Spring, 2020

**Instructor:** Cam Flowers  
**Lecture:** Tuesdays & Thursdays 6:00-7:40 p.m.  
**Office Hours:** Tuesdays/Thursdays 5-6 p.m.  
**Grading:** Letter Grade

## Rationalle

Some of the most exciting technological developments are occuring via web-based frameworks across the full stack. In this course we will discuss frontend and backend programming in Javascript and learn the essentials of modern web development. 

Any student of a technological field-and especially students of computer science/engineering-would be well-served by developing an understanding of the web and a proficiency in creation of the applications that it enables.

## Course Aims and Outcomes 
### Aims
As a result of participating in this course, students will be able to explain the various elements of the web ecosystem, demonstrate proficiency in the fundamental languages of web programming, and create web applications using contemporary tooling in preparation for a career involving web development. 

### Specific Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be well-versed in the fundamentals of web application development. Emphasis is placed on developing a foundation in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including a knowledge of their historical revisions and browser adoption of their latest versions. Building on this foundation, client-side JavaScript frameworks are introduced; students will learn the concepts, syntax, and benefits of jQuery (as it is still widely used despite having fallen out of favor for newer frameworks) then learn a more contemporary front-end JavaScript framework (e.g. vue.js). Students should be able to develop aesthetically pleasing single place applications (SPAs) by this juncture in the course. The course will then introduce back-end web application constructs such as databases and application servers. By the completion of the course, students will be able to develop a “full stack” web application and discuss the benefits of various architectures, design patterns, and elements of production-readyness. Specific concepts and technologies are highlighted in the course schedule below.

## Format and Procedures
This course meets once per week for a 3.5-hour period without an additional lab component. This course is intended to reflect industry norms as much as possible; to that end, project delivery and collaboration are emphasized over attendance and summative assessment.

## Assumptions
This course has no prerequisite courses; however, students are expected to be proficient in general programming principles and able to code in at least one language. Such experience will ensure that students are able to expediently learn new programming languages as they are introduced in this course.

No web development experience is required; this course assumes that students do not have any prior knowledge of the subject matter. 

Note that this is not a web *design* course. Presentation is covered and general design tools will be discussed, but the emphasis is on application programming using the web as a platform.

## Course Requirements
Tasks and assignments are intended to align with the learning outcomes specified above.

### Class attendance and participation policy

Attendance is not a graded component of this class, though students are encouraged to attend all lectures to fully benefit from the delivered lectures and peer discussion. 

### Course readings

In adhering to "real-world" industry norms, this class does not have any required texts, as all course material can be obtained through various free online resources. However, various readings will be recommended during the course of this class and will likely be helpful to student learning.

## Academic Integrity

This course observed and upholds the [CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity](http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/about/policies_pdf/CUNYAcademicIntegrityPolicy.pdf) ([Accessible Plain Text](http://www.lehman.edu/lehman/about/policies_pdf/CUNYAcademicIntegrityPolicy.txt)). Each student in this course is expected to abide by this policy. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. Collaboration is allowed where assignments are designated as group projects.

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a diskette, or a hard copy. 

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action. 

During examinations, you must do your own work. Talking or discussion is not permitted during the examinations, nor may you compare papers, copy from others, or collaborate in any way. Any collaborative behavior during the examinations will result in failure of the exam, and may lead to failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## Reasonable Accommodations and Academic Adjustments
